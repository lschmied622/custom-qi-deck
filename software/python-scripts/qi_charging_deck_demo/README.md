# Modified Crazyflie Python Scripts

This directory contains only the **modified Python scripts** relevant to the customized functionality developed as part of the bachelor thesis. These scripts are intended to extend or adapt the behavior of the official Crazyflie Python client and related libraries.

> ⚠️ **Important:** These files do not constitute a standalone executable environment. To run or test these scripts, the full Crazyflie Python library and its dependencies must be installed.
